## âœ… Interview Questions & Answers

### 1. **What is an Activity in Android?**
An Activity is a single screen with a user interface. It acts as the entry point for user interaction with the app.

---

### 2. **What is the Activity Lifecycle?**
Main lifecycle methods:
- `onCreate()`
- `onStart()`
- `onResume()`
- `onPause()`
- `onStop()`
- `onDestroy()`
- `onRestart()`

---

### 3. **What is the difference between Activity and Fragment?**
- **Activity**: Complete screen.
- **Fragment**: Reusable portion of UI in an activity.
- Fragments help with modular UI.

---

### 4. **What is ViewModel?**
`ViewModel` stores UI-related data and survives configuration changes like screen rotation. It separates UI logic from activity/fragment.

---

### 5. **What is an Intent?**
Intent is used to launch other activities or services.  
- **Explicit Intent**: Starts a specific component.  
- **Implicit Intent**: Requests an action (like opening a URL or camera).

---

### 6. **What is LiveData?**
`LiveData` is a lifecycle-aware observable data holder. It automatically updates the UI when data changes.

---

### 7. **What is Room Database?**
Room is a Jetpack component for using SQLite in Android with compile-time verification of SQL queries and data abstraction.

---

### 8. **What is Retrofit?**
Retrofit is a REST client for Android. It helps in making API calls and converting JSON to Java/Kotlin models.

---

### 9. **Coroutine vs Thread?**
- **Thread**: Heavyweight, managed by OS.  
- **Coroutine**: Lightweight, better for managing background tasks and concurrency in Kotlin.

---

### 10. **Explain MVVM Architecture.**
- **Model**: Data layer (API, DB)  
- **View**: UI components  
- **ViewModel**: Connects UI and data, handles business logic

---

### 11. **What is Data Binding?**
It allows binding UI components directly to data sources in XML, reducing boilerplate code.

---

### 12. **What is the difference between onSaveInstanceState() and ViewModel?**
- `onSaveInstanceState()`: Saves small data in Bundle.  
- `ViewModel`: Keeps data during configuration changes without rebinding UI manually.

---

### 13. **What is WorkManager?**
Used for deferrable background tasks that are guaranteed to execute even if the app closes or the device restarts.

---

### 14. **Common causes of memory leaks in Android?**
- Static references to Context  
- Not unregistering BroadcastReceivers or listeners  
- Long-running background tasks
